# extract-pdf
I have only ARK investment report in pdf; hope to convert it into raw data in models; and could be presented in a graph tool. Apache PDFBox provides a PDFTextStripper, which is able to extract all text from pdf file ignoring formatting. Meaning while I build a state machine and regular expression to extract data into data models.
