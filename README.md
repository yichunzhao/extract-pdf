handling PDF using Apache PDFBox, extracting text from a Pdf file

I have only ARK investment report in pdf; hope to convert it into raw data in models; and could be presented in a graph tool.

The Apache PDFBox provides a PDFTextStripper, which is able to extract all text from pdf file ignoring formatings.  

Disussion: 
It is over-killing to use a state-machine for this case; I want to present a state pattern.
